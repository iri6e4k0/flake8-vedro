# VDR400. contexts should have an assertion
The Vedro framework Сontexts should contain an assertion. The context determines the bringing of the service into a specific state. These guarantees use statements on the status pages, as well as in the history of mocks, the presence of which is mandatory.
### ❌ Anti-pattern
```python
# ./contexts/registered_user.py
import vedro
from interfaces.chat_api import ChatApi

@vedro.context
def registered_user(user):
    response = ChatApi().register(user) # <- no assert

```
### ✅Best practice
```python
# ./contexts/registered_user.py
import vedro
from interfaces.chat_api import ChatApi

@vedro.context
def registered_user(user):
    response = ChatApi().register(user)
    assert response.status_code == 200
```
